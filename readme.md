Python 3.10.8


Web app using Python3, SQLite3 and Flask to build and edit a database of workout routines that can be tracked over time.  

To do list:

Database:
    <!-- Update Exercise table so columns are correct (will need to re-run python) -->
    <!-- Equipment name should be set to "NOT NULL" - check for others like Muscles -->

Global:
    <!-- improve where footer sits -->
    delete button from tables
    make table headers sticky
    <!-- drop down tables have text to select -->
    <!-- drop down tables are dynamic and filter for the next drop down -->

Exercise
    <!-- make the add button on exercises functional -->
    Make a default exercise for each exercise type so the variation can be prioritized as the first in the drop down

Muscles
    <!-- make the add botton on muscles functional -->

Routine
    <!-- make dropdown in routine to select exercise and variation as one -->
    <!-- once exercises are selected, add to routine and make table text editable -->
    <!-- create a routine in python and then store the routine when marked complete in history database -->
    <!-- Make placeholder data dynamic, so it shows the last sets, reps, weight and notes -->
    <!-- Add row button -->

History
    <!-- show history on page -->
    create a more dynamic calendar: https://github.com/Serhioromano/bootstrap-calendar

Index
    <!-- show last 30 entries of exercises -->
    collapsible table for workouts:
